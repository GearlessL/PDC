# The code of algorithms
* Peeling: the state-of-the-art sequential D-core decomposition algorithm;
* AC: the distributed anchored coreness-based D-core decomposition algorithm, and we parallelize it by using multi-threads;
* SC: the state-of-the-art distributed skyline coreness-based D-core decomposition algorithm, and we parallelize it by using multi-threads;
* ParPeel: our proposed parallel D-core decomposition algorithm, which is depicted in Algorithm 3;
* ParPeel+: our proposed parallel D-core decomposition algorithm in Algorithm 3 with shell-based pruning strategy in Section 5.1;
* Shell-PDC: our proposed parallel D-core decomposition algorithm, listed in Algorithm 5.


# Compiling and Running
## Compiling the program
```
g++ -std=c++17 -fopenmp ${fileDirname}/*.cpp -o ${FILE_NAME}
```

For example:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -fopenmp ./src/*.cpp -o dcore
```


## Running the program:
```
./${FILE_NAME} -t ${THREAD} -f ${GRAPH_FILE} -a ${ALGORITHM}
```

For example:
```
./dcore \
-t 64 \
-f ./materials/em.txt \
-a 6 
```

For simply, we can run the program via a script ```./run.py```.




## Input format
* THREAD:
The number of threads.

* GRAPH_FILE:
The first line is consited of # of nodes and # of directed edges in the graph, which is denoted as following.
```
${NODES} ${EDGE}
``` 
Remains line represents a directed edge from node u to node v, which is presented as following.
```
${u} ${v}
```


* ALGORITHM:
The id of algorithm will be running, which the id is presented as following.

| id | algorithms |
| :----: | :----: |
| 1 | Peeling |
| 2 | AC |
| 3 | SC |
| 4 | ParPeel |
| 5 | ParPeel+ |
| 6 | Shell-PDC |
